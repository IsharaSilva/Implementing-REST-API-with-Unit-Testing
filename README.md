# Implementing-REST-API-with-Unit-Testing

This is a simple step-by-step guide on how to implement a Unit test for REST API using the Spring framework with MySQL as the database. This guide will cover creating unit tests for simple "Supplier" entity with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
Our testing suite ensured that every layer of the application, from controllers to repositories, underwent thorough testing, leading to a high code coverage of more than 90%.
